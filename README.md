# Midiraja (midra)

**Midiraja** (command: `midra`) is a terminal-native MIDI player built for command-line use.

## Features

- **Retro synthesizer engines** — OPL2/OPL3 FM, OPN2, Gravis Ultrasound, PSG/MSX+SCC, 1-bit — all embedded in the binary, no external libraries needed
- **External MIDI routing** — send events to OS native ports (CoreMIDI, Windows GS, ALSA) or hardware synthesizers via USB/MIDI
- **High-fidelity emulation** — optionally links against FluidSynth (SoundFont) or Munt (Roland MT-32) if installed on the system
- **Live playback control** — adjust speed, transpose key, and master volume while playing
- **DSP effects rack** — tube saturation, stereo chorus, algorithmic reverb (room/hall/plate/chamber/spring/cave), 3-band EQ, LPF/HPF — applies to any built-in engine
- **Three TUI modes** — full-screen dashboard with 16-channel VU meters (`--full`), compact single-line widget (`--mini`), plain console output (`--classic`)
- **Playlist support** — M3U files, recursive directory scan, shuffle, loop

## Motivation

This project started from three personal goals:

1. I own several retro MIDI tone generators (SC-55, SC-88, MT-32, MU100 and similar) and wanted a simple CLI player to audition MIDI files through them. Nothing that existed quite fit the workflow.

2. I needed a personal project of realistic scope to practice coding with AI agents.

3. Modern Java has been evolving toward leaner syntax and a lighter runtime — Project Loom, the Foreign Function & Memory API, GraalVM native image. I wanted a concrete target to validate how far that has come.
