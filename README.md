# Midiraja (midra) 🎵

**Midiraja** (command: `midra`) is a lightning-fast, zero-dependency MIDI player for your terminal. 

Whether you want to quickly preview a `.mid` file, practice an instrument by changing the key and tempo on the fly, or just listen to a folder full of retro game soundtracks through historically accurate software synthesizers, `midra` makes it incredibly easy.

## ✨ The 3 Ways to Play
Midiraja isn't just a player; it's a universal audio router. It can output your MIDI files in three fundamentally different ways depending on your needs:

1. **External OS Ports (Hardware & Software):** By default, Midiraja acts as a sequencer, routing raw MIDI events directly to your OS's native ports (like Apple CoreMIDI or Windows GS Wavetable) or to your own external hardware synthesizers connected via USB/MIDI.
2. **Built-in Retro Engines (Zero-Dependency):** Want instant retro sound without installing anything? Midiraja contains pure-mathematical emulators built directly into the binary. Enjoy Gravis Ultrasound (`gus`), AdLib FM (`opl`/`opn`), and a custom purist 1-Bit Digital Cluster (`beep`) instantly.
3. **Shared Library Linking:** If you have industry-standard C-libraries installed on your system (like `fluid-synth` or `munt`), Midiraja will dynamically link to them, allowing for ultra-high-fidelity SoundFont rendering or cycle-accurate Roland MT-32 emulation.

## 🖥️ The 3 Ways to View
Experience your music with three adaptive Terminal UI modes:
* **`--full` (`-3`):** A glorious full-screen dashboard featuring 16-channel VU meters, progress bars, and a dynamic playlist queue.
* **`--mini` (`-2`):** A compact, single-line status widget perfect for background listening while you work in another split terminal.
* **`--classic` (`-1`):** Standard, pipe-friendly console output.

## 🎛️ Live Playback Control
Change the playback speed, transpose the musical key, or tweak the master volume *while* the music is playing—and keep those settings persistent across an entire folder of files!
