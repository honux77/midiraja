# Midiraja (midra) 🎵

**Midiraja** (command: `midra`) is a lightweight, interactive MIDI player for your terminal. 

Whether you want to quickly preview a `.mid` file, practice an instrument by changing the key and tempo on the fly, or just listen to a folder full of retro game soundtracks, `midra` makes it incredibly easy.

## ✨ Features
* **Rich Terminal UI**: Experience MIDI like never before with three adaptive display modes:
  * `--full` (`-3`): A glorious full-screen dashboard with 16-channel VU meters, progress bars, and a dynamic playlist.
  * `--mini` (`-2`): A compact, single-line status widget perfect for background listening.
  * `--classic` (`-1`): Standard, pipe-friendly console output.
* **Zero Config**: Automatically detects and plays through your native OS MIDI synthesizers (CoreMIDI, ALSA, WinMM).
* **Live Controls**: Change playback speed, transpose the key, or tweak the volume *while* the music is playing—and keep those settings across the entire playlist!
* **Playlists**: Toss in a folder full of files. Shuffle, loop, and skip tracks seamlessly.

## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start
Just type `midra` followed by the file you want to play. If you have multiple MIDI devices, a menu will pop up asking you to choose one.
```bash
midra PASSPORT.MID
```

### Playlists & Folders
You can pass multiple files at once. `midra` will play them one after another.
```bash
# Play all MIDI files in the current folder
midra *.mid

# Play a playlist endlessly in a random order
midra --loop --shuffle *.mid
```

### Starting with Specific Settings
You can set the starting volume, tempo, key, or even jump to a specific time right from the command line:
```bash
# Start at 1 minute and 30 seconds
midra --start 01:30 song.mid

# Play at 1.5x speed
midra --speed 1.5 song.mid

# Transpose the song one octave up (+12 semitones) and lower volume
midra --transpose 12 --volume 50 song.mid
```
