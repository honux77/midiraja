# PSG Audio Engineering & Tracker Hacks Whitepaper

**Status:** Research & Design Phase (Target: `midra psg`)

This document outlines the architectural blueprint for the upcoming Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) emulator in Midiraja. Our goal is not simply to emulate the hardware specifications of the AY-3-8910 or SN76489 chips, but to **emulate the software tricks (Tracker Techniques)** that 1980s demoscene hackers used to push this hardware far beyond its physical limits.

## 1. The Hardware Reality (The Constraint)

A standard PSG chip (like the Yamaha YM2149F found in MSX and Atari ST) provides extremely limited resources:
* **3 Tone Channels:** Capable of generating pure Square Waves.
* **1 Noise Generator:** A Pseudo-Random LFSR generator.
* **1 Hardware Envelope Generator:** A single, global timer that can apply geometric volume shapes (Sawtooth, Triangle, Decay) to any channel.
* **4-Bit Volume:** Each channel's volume can only be set to 16 discrete levels (0-15).

If a standard modern MIDI file (with 16 channels, 128-level velocity, and 10-note polyphony) is fed directly into this hardware, it will sound terrible. Notes will be dropped, chords will be impossible, and the volume will feel flat.

## 2. The Demoscene Tricks (The Architecture)

To bridge the gap between rich MIDI files and 3-channel hardware, the Midiraja `psg` engine will implement a **Tracker-Driven Interception Layer**. Instead of feeding MIDI directly to the chip, MIDI events will be caught by a virtual 50Hz/60Hz (VBLANK) software "Tracker" that applies the following historical hacks:

### 2.1. Fast Arpeggios (Fake Chords)
* **The Problem:** The chip only has 3 channels. A simple C-Major chord (C-E-G) consumes 100% of the chip's resources, leaving no room for bass or melody.
* **The Hack:** When polyphonic notes arrive on a single MIDI channel, the Tracker intercepts them. Instead of assigning them to multiple hardware pins, it assigns them to *one* pin and rapidly switches the frequency of that pin between the 3 notes every 1/60th of a second.
* **The Result:** The human ear blends the rapidly alternating notes into a single, cohesive chord. This creates the iconic, bubbling "chiptune arpeggio" texture.

### 2.2. Hardware Envelope as Audio (Buzzer/SID Voice)
* **The Problem:** PSGs only output square waves, making the basslines sound thin compared to the Commodore 64's legendary SID chip (which had sawtooth and triangle waves).
* **The Hack:** The hardware envelope generator is supposed to run slowly (e.g., 2Hz to fade out a note). Hackers realized that if you crank the envelope frequency up to 50Hz-400Hz (Audio Rate), the volume fades so fast that the envelope itself becomes a raw Sawtooth waveform!
* **The Implementation:** For MIDI notes below C3 (130Hz), the engine will disable the standard Tone generator and instead synchronize the Hardware Envelope frequency to the MIDI note pitch, generating a massive, aggressive Buzz/Sawtooth bassline.

### 2.3. Software Envelopes (4-Bit Stepped Decay)
* **The Problem:** There is only 1 hardware envelope generator for the whole chip. If you use it for the bassline, the melody and chords will have no volume decay.
* **The Hack:** Composers ignored the hardware envelope and manually updated the 4-bit volume registers (R8, R9, R10) using software interrupts.
* **The Implementation:** Midiraja will use a 50Hz software tick to manually decrement the volume of active notes from 15 down to 0. This creates a distinct, stepped, "zipper-like" fade-out effect that is the hallmark of MSX/ZX Spectrum soundtracks, completely rejecting smooth 64-bit floating-point volume curves.

### 2.4. Interleaved Noise (Pitched Snare Drums)
* **The Problem:** A snare drum needs both "Noise" (the rattle) and "Tone" (the body), but mixing them statically sounds muddy.
* **The Hack:** Rapidly toggle a channel's mixer register between Tone mode and Noise mode on alternate frames.
* **The Implementation:** When MIDI Channel 10 (Drums) triggers a snare, the Tracker will interleave 1 frame of pure white noise with 1 frame of a 200Hz square wave, creating a punchy, aggressive 8-bit drum hit.

## 3. The Expansion: Konami SCC (K051649) Emulation

While the PSG is powerful when hacked, it remains limited by its pure square waves. To solve this, Midiraja fully emulates the **Konami SCC (Sound Custom Chip)**, the legendary expansion cartridge chip used in late MSX games (like *Gradius II* and *Snatcher*).

### 3.1. MSX Pair Architecture (1x PSG + 1x SCC)
* **The Concept:** The SCC lacks a noise generator and hardware envelopes, making it terrible for drums and aggressive bass. Historically, the SCC was *never* used alone; it was always plugged into an MSX machine containing a PSG.
* **The Implementation:** When the `--scc` flag is enabled, the Midiraja engine instantiates chips in **Pairs**. `System 1` consists of `[Chip 0: PSG] + [Chip 1: SCC]`. 
* **Smart Routing:**
  * **Drums (Channel 10):** Forced onto the PSG (Chip 0) to utilize its Noise Generator for crisp snares and hi-hats.
  * **Melody/Chords:** Routed to the SCC (Chip 1) to utilize its 5 custom wavetable channels for rich, lush sounds. Overflow drops back to the PSG's square waves.

### 3.2. 32-Byte Procedural Wavetables & Interpolation
* **The Hardware:** The SCC uses a tiny 32-byte RAM buffer per channel to define a custom waveform (-128 to +127).
* **The Implementation:** Instead of violating copyright by dumping original Konami ROMs, Midiraja procedurally generates mathematically pure 32-byte waves based on the General MIDI instrument family (e.g., `sin(t)*0.8 + sin(3t)*0.2` for Strings/Pads, decaying Sawtooth for Pianos). 
* **Anti-Aliasing:** To prevent harsh bit-crushing when reading only 32 samples, the engine uses **Linear Interpolation** across a double-precision phase accumulator, resulting in incredibly smooth analog-like output.

### 3.3. Volume Compensation (RMS Matching)
* **The Problem:** A pure square wave (PSG) has massive RMS energy compared to a sine or triangle wave (SCC). If played together at "max volume," the SCC melodies would be completely drowned out by the PSG drums.
* **The Solution:** The SCC engine applies a **1.75x Volume Boost** and uses the exact same non-linear DAC mapping table as the PSG, ensuring perfect mixing balance between the two drastically different architectures.

### 3.4. Smart Instrument-Matching Arpeggios
* **The Enhancement:** Building on the Fast Arpeggio hack (2.1), the engine now intelligently handles polyphony overflow across both PSG and SCC.
* **The Logic:** When a chord is played and channels run out, the engine searches the chip for a channel *already playing that exact MIDI instrument*. It then silently converts that single-note channel into an Arpeggio channel, sliding the new note into its 4-note buffer. This ensures Pianos arpeggiate with Pianos, and Strings with Strings, preventing chaotic "hard stealing" of unrelated tracks.
