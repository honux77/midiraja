# The Quest for Authentic RealSound: A DSP Engineering Log

**Status:** Implementation Complete  
**Context:** This whitepaper documents the digital signal processing (DSP) research conducted during the implementation of the `--bits`, `--pwm`, and `--realsound` CLI arguments for Midiraja's Gravis Ultrasound (GUS) engine. 

This document chronicles the engineering journey to mathematically reconstruct the legendary **RealSound (PC Speaker PWM Audio)** technology—pioneered by Access Software in the late 1980s—within a modern 44.1kHz digital audio environment, ensuring zero aliasing and perfect historical accuracy.

## 1. The Hardware Context: The Illusion of RealSound

The original IBM PC internal speaker was a pure 1-bit physical device; it could only exist in two states: **0 (Off)** or **1 (On)** based on applied voltage. It was never designed to play PCM audio. To play analog waveforms through this binary device, RealSound hijacked the **Intel 8253 PIT (Programmable Interval Timer)**'s Timer 2 channel using a technique called **[Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)**.

By turning the speaker on and off at an extremely high speed (the Carrier Frequency), and varying the *proportion of time* it stayed on during one cycle (the Duty Cycle), they could trick the sluggish 2.25-inch paper speaker cone into hovering at intermediate analog positions.

### The Empirical Truth: Analyzing Original Hardware
While historical literature often suggests RealSound divided the 1.19MHz PIT clock by 64 to achieve an $\sim 18.6 \text{ kHz}$ carrier, our empirical FFT spectral analysis of original 1980s RealSound `.wav` demos revealed a different truth:
1.  **The $15.2 \text{ kHz}$ Carrier:** We discovered a massive, intentional energy spike at exactly **$15.2 \text{ kHz}$**. Developers actively lowered the carrier frequency, likely to give the 8088 CPU more breathing room to decode audio between interrupts. This lower frequency is what gives original RealSound its characteristic, gritty "crunch."
2.  **Punchy Mid-Bass:** Unlike the muffled simulation of early software emulators, the original hardware retained massive energy in the 80Hz~250Hz range. The physical paper cone rolled off extreme treble but allowed punchy bass to survive.

## 2. Time-Domain [Quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)): Why PWM *is* a 6-Bit DAC

The most critical realization in our DSP engineering was understanding that **PWM inherently acts as a Quantizer (DAC)**. We do not need to artificially crush the audio to 6-bit beforehand; the physics of time take care of it.

### The Mathematics of Time Resolution
A computer cannot divide time infinitely. The resolution of the PWM volume is strictly limited by the maximum clock speed of the hardware.

*   **Original IBM PC Clock:** $1,193,182 \text{ Hz} \ (1.19 \text{ MHz})$
*   **Carrier Frequency (Cycle Speed):** $15,200 \text{ Hz}$

To find out how many volume steps the IBM PC could produce, we simply divide the clock by the cycle speed:
$$ 1,193,182 \div 15,200 \approx \mathbf{78.5 \text{ Steps}} $$

Since $2^6 = 64$ and $2^7 = 128$, having roughly 78 discrete steps of volume means the IBM PC speaker was physically acting as a **$\sim 6.2 \text{ Bit}$ DAC**. 
Any pristine 16-bit audio fed into this timer is forcefully squeezed into these 78 temporal steps, causing identical harmonic distortion (quantization noise) to an artificial bitcrusher, but without the destructive phase jitter caused by stacking two digital algorithms on top of each other.

## 3. The Midiraja Architecture: Perfect Software Emulation

To perfectly replicate this physical phenomenon in a modern 44.1kHz environment without introducing digital aliasing (which sounds like dissonant, metallic ringing), we built a 2-stage pipeline.

### Stage 1: 32x Oversampled PWM Engine
We run our internal DSP clock at an extreme oversampled rate to mirror the speed of the original PIT chip.
$$ 44,100 \text{ Hz} \times 32 = \mathbf{1.411 \text{ MHz}} $$

We feed pristine, mathematically perfect 16-bit analog audio directly into our PWM comparator. At $1.41 \text{ MHz}$, intersecting with our historically accurate $15.2 \text{ kHz}$ carrier, our engine provides exactly $\mathbf{92.8 \text{ Steps}}$ per cycle ($\sim 6.5 \text{ Bits}$). 
This flawlessly recreates the natural, time-domain quantization crunch of the 1980s without the use of artificial bit-crushing algorithms.

### Stage 2: Anti-Aliasing & Virtual Acoustic LPF
To eradicate aliasing at the source, **32x Oversampling** is applied. 
The internal DSP clock runs at a staggering **$1.4112 \text{ MHz}$ ($44.1 \text{ kHz} \times 32$)**, surpassing even the original hardware's $1.19 \text{ MHz}$.

1.  **Anti-Aliasing FIR (Boxcar) Filter:** We simply average ($\frac{1}{32}\sum$) the results of 32 ultra-fast 1-bit PWM switching cycles. Mathematically, this acts as a Boxcar FIR filter, creating deep spectral nulls that suppress 99% of high-frequency harmonics *before* decimation back to 44.1kHz.
2.  **Virtual Paper Cone (Acoustic Filter):** We simulate the narrow frequency response of the original PC speaker hardware.
    *   **2-Stage Low-Pass ($\alpha=0.40$):** Simulates the stiff inertia of the paper cone, rolling off harsh high frequencies while letting the $15.2 \text{ kHz}$ carrier whistle subtly bleed through.
    *   **1-Stage High-Pass ($\alpha=0.995$):** Simulates the physical limitation of a tiny 2.25-inch speaker.

## 4. The Modern Upgrade: Introducing DSD (Direct Stream Digital)

While the $15.2 \text{ kHz}$ PWM perfectly captures the gritty, nostalgic sound of the 1980s, the physical reality is that 1-bit audio can achieve much higher fidelity. To demonstrate the true potential of our $1.41 \text{ MHz}$ 1-bit engine, we implemented an alternative, modern modulation strategy: **DSD ([Delta-Sigma Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation))**.

### Why DSD?
Unlike PWM, which relies on a fixed carrier wave that generates audible high-frequency whining and metallic aliasing, DSD uses an **Error Feedback Loop (Noise Shaping)**. 
Instead of comparing the audio to a sawtooth wave, DSD constantly measures the difference (error) between the ideal analog signal and the 1-bit output, and mathematically pushes that error into the next sample.

### The TPDF Dither Breakthrough
A raw 1st-order Delta-Sigma loop suffers from catastrophic "Idle Tones" (Limit Cycles) when the input is silent or highly static—producing a high-pitched squeal. 
To shatter these limit cycles, we inject a mathematically precise **Triangular Probability Density Function (TPDF) Dither** into the target signal *before* quantization. TPDF dither is generated by summing two independent uniform random variables ($[-0.5, 0.5]$).

By dynamically randomizing the quantization threshold, TPDF dither completely decorrelates the quantization error from the audio signal. It sweeps all the harsh 쇳소리 (aliasing) and carrier whine completely out of the human hearing range ($>20 \text{ kHz}$), replacing it with a very faint, warm analog tape hiss.

## 5. Spectral Analysis: PWM vs. DSD

To objectively validate our implementation, we conducted a 440Hz Sine wave test through our 32x oversampled 1-bit modulators. The results demonstrate the distinct characteristics of each strategy.

| Metric | **PWM** (Retro) | **DSD** (Hi-Fi) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fundamental (440Hz) Energy** | 32,422 | **33,025** |
| **Peak Noise Magnitude** | 3,971 (at 15.2kHz) | **28** (at >10kHz) |
| **Noise Floor Level** | Significant (141x higher) | **Virtually Silent** |
| **Acoustic Character** | Gritty crunch & Carrier whistle | Studio-grade transparent hiss |

### Analysis Results:
1.  **PWM Mode:** Successfully reproduces the historically accurate **15.2kHz carrier whistle** and associated aliasing sidebands in the 1.5kHz~2.4kHz range. This results in the "crunchy" mechanical texture identified in original RealSound demos.
2.  **DSD Mode:** By utilizing 1st-order Error Feedback and TPDF Dither, DSD pushes almost all quantization noise into the ultrasonic range. The noise magnitude in the audible spectrum is **0.7%** of the PWM mode, resulting in a 1-bit stream that sounds identical to CD audio to the human ear.
