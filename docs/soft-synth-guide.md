# Soft Synth Guide

`midra` supports three built-in software synthesizers in addition to the native OS MIDI output. Each has a different sound character and setup requirements.

| Synthesizer | Flag | Sound | External files |
|-------------|------|-------|----------------|
| FluidSynth | `--fluid` | General MIDI (SF2) | SoundFont (.sf2) |
| MT-32 / Munt | `--munt` | Roland MT-32 (DOS-era game music) | 2 ROM files |
| OPL / libADLMIDI | `--opl` | AdLib / Sound Blaster FM (OPL2/OPL3) | Built-in (optional .wopl bank) |

## FluidSynth (General MIDI / SF2)

FluidSynth is a **sample-based synthesizer**. It plays back pre-recorded instrument samples stored in SF2 SoundFont files, blending and looping them to produce each note. Because the source material is real recorded audio, it can achieve highly realistic instrument tones. Sound quality depends almost entirely on the SoundFont used — a high-quality SF2 file with large multi-velocity samples will sound dramatically better than a minimal one.

### Installation

FluidSynth is loaded dynamically at runtime. Install it via your package manager.

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install fluid-synth
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install libfluidsynth3
```

**Fedora / RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install fluidsynth
```

### SoundFont

FluidSynth requires an SF2 SoundFont file. Some freely available options:

- **GeneralUser GS** (`generaluser.sf2`) — lightweight, good quality. [Download](https://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php)
- **MuseScore General** — bundled with MuseScore. macOS path: `/Applications/MuseScore 4.app/Contents/Resources/sound/MuseScore_General.sf2`
- **FluidR3 GM** — available as an Ubuntu package: `sudo apt install fluid-soundfont-gm`

### Usage

```bash
# Specify the path to a SoundFont file
midra --fluid /path/to/soundfont.sf2 song.mid

# With playlist options
midra --fluid /path/to/soundfont.sf2 --loop --shuffle *.mid
```

### Audio driver override (optional)

If FluidSynth fails to auto-detect the audio driver, specify it explicitly:

```bash
midra --fluid soundfont.sf2 --fluid-driver coreaudio song.mid   # macOS
midra --fluid soundfont.sf2 --fluid-driver alsa song.mid        # Linux
```

## MT-32 / Munt

The Roland MT-32 (1987) uses **LA (Linear Arithmetic) synthesis** — a hybrid approach that combines short PCM attack transient samples with digitally synthesized sustain waveforms, shaped by multi-stage envelopes and a built-in reverb unit. The result is a distinctive, lush sound that defined the audio of late-1980s and early-1990s DOS game music. Titles like Monkey Island, Wing Commander, Ultima, and many Sierra adventure games were scored specifically for MT-32 and sound substantially different — and often richer — on it than on General MIDI.

Munt is an open-source MT-32 emulator that requires ROM dumps from real hardware for accurate reproduction.

### Installation

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install munt
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install libmt32emu3
```

**Fedora / RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install munt
```

### ROM files

Munt requires ROM dumps from real MT-32 hardware. Place both files in the same directory:

```
~/mt32-roms/
  MT32_CONTROL.ROM   (64 KB)
  MT32_PCM.ROM       (512 KB)
```

> ROM files are proprietary Roland intellectual property. Only use ROMs you have extracted from hardware you own or obtained through legally permitted means.

ROM files from CM-32L and LAPC-I variants are also supported.

### Usage

```bash
# Specify the directory containing the ROM files
midra --munt ~/mt32-roms song.mid

# MT-32 playlist
midra --munt ~/mt32-roms --loop monkey_island/*.mid
```

## OPL FM Synthesis / libADLMIDI

OPL chips (Yamaha OPL2/OPL3, 1985–1993) use **FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis** — a technique where one oscillator (the modulator) modulates the frequency of another (the carrier), producing complex, harmonically rich timbres from simple sine waves alone. With no sample memory, the entire sound is computed mathematically in real time. This gives FM synthesis its characteristic bright, metallic, slightly buzzy quality: recognizable in the soundtracks of countless DOS games that targeted AdLib and Sound Blaster cards.

OPL2 provides 9 melodic channels (2-operator FM each); OPL3 adds stereo, 4-operator mode, and up to 18 channels. libADLMIDI maps General MIDI to OPL operators using instrument banks, and can emulate multiple chips simultaneously to increase polyphony.

libADLMIDI is **statically linked** into the `midra` binary — no installation required.

### Usage

```bash
# Default bank (General MIDI)
midra --opl song.mid

# Built-in bank by number (0–75)
midra --opl 58 song.mid    # TMB (Descent)
midra --opl 14 song.mid    # Doom

# External .wopl bank file
midra --opl /path/to/custom.wopl song.mid
```

### Built-in banks (selected)

libADLMIDI includes 76 built-in instrument banks. Notable ones:

| # | Name | Source |
|---|------|--------|
| 0 | GeneralMidi | General purpose |
| 14 | Doom | id Software Doom |
| 17 | Heretic | Raven Software Heretic |
| 32 | Warcraft2 | Blizzard Warcraft II |
| 47 | Duke3D | 3D Realms Duke Nukem 3D |
| 58 | TMB | Interplay Descent |
| 62 | Ys2 | Falcom Ys II |

For the full list see the [libADLMIDI documentation](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI#embedded-banks).

### OPL emulator selection

Several OPL emulator backends are available:

```bash
midra --opl --opl-emulator 0 song.mid   # Nuked OPL3 v1.8 (default, highest accuracy)
midra --opl --opl-emulator 1 song.mid   # Nuked OPL3 v1.7.4
midra --opl --opl-emulator 5 song.mid   # ESFMu (ESFM extension support)
midra --opl --opl-emulator 6 song.mid   # MAME OPL2 (suitable for OPL2-only songs)
midra --opl --opl-emulator 7 song.mid   # YMFM OPL2
midra --opl --opl-emulator 8 song.mid   # YMFM OPL3
```

### Chip count (polyphony)

More chips means more simultaneous voices:

```bash
midra --opl --opl-chips 1 song.mid   # 1 chip = 18 channels (authentic single AdLib card)
midra --opl --opl-chips 4 song.mid   # 4 chips = 72 channels (default)
```

## Checking the active synthesizer

Use `--list-ports` to confirm which synthesizer is selected:

```bash
midra --opl --list-ports
# Available MIDI Output Devices:
# [0] Nuked OPL3 v1.8 · 4 chips

midra --munt ~/mt32-roms --list-ports
# Available MIDI Output Devices:
# [0] MT-32 (Munt)

midra --fluid soundfont.sf2 --list-ports
# Available MIDI Output Devices:
# [0] FluidSynth
```
