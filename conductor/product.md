# Initial Concept
A cross-platform CLI tool for playing MIDI files to external or virtual MIDI devices using GraalVM Native Image and JNA.

## Target Audience
- **Software Developers:** Testing MIDI implementations or requiring a fast, scriptable player.
- **Musicians/Producers:** Needing a quick way to preview MIDI files directly in the terminal without opening heavy DAWs.

## Key Features
- **Native Port Playback:** Direct communication with OS-level MIDI subsystems (CoreMIDI on macOS, WinMM on Windows, ALSA on Linux) via JNA.
- **Advanced CLI Controls & UI:** Full-screen responsive Terminal User Interface (TUI) with real-time VU meters, playlist tracking, and dynamic layout adaptation based on terminal size. Also supports adjusting playback parameters such as volume control (`--volume`), transposition (`--transpose`), tempo scaling, and channel muting.
- **Smart & Interactive Port Selection:** Easily select MIDI ports by partial name matching, or use the interactive prompt when a port is not explicitly provided.

## Primary Design Goal
- **Performance & Speed:** Built with GraalVM Native Image to eliminate JVM cold start times, ensuring near-instantaneous execution and minimal resource consumption.
