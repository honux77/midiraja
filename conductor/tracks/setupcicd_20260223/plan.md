# Implementation Plan: Setup CI/CD Pipeline

## Phase 1: Workflow Setup
- [x] Task: Create a basic GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/build.yml`). c172e8c
- [x] Task: Configure the environment to install Java 25+ and GraalVM. 418078a
- [x] Task: Add steps to build the project using Gradle (`./gradlew build`). 5504d13
- [x] Task: Add steps to run tests (`./gradlew test`). d8dc9f4
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Workflow Setup' (Protocol in workflow.md) [checkpoint: aa0b6c9]

## Phase 2: Cross-Platform Native Compilation
- [x] Task: Configure matrix strategy to build on `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `ubuntu-latest`. 1ca8d2b
- [ ] Task: Ensure required native build tools are available in each runner.
- [ ] Task: Add the `nativeCompile` step to the workflow.
- [ ] Task: Verify that the native executable is generated for each platform.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Cross-Platform Native Compilation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Release Automation
- [ ] Task: Create a new workflow for release automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered on tag pushes.
- [ ] Task: Add steps to build the cross-platform native executables.
- [ ] Task: Configure the workflow to create a GitHub Release and upload the generated binaries as artifacts.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Release Automation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
