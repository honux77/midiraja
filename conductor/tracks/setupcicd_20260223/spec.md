# Specification: Setup CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This track involves setting up an automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Midraja project. The pipeline will automate the build, test, and release processes for the cross-platform native executables (macOS, Windows, Linux) built with GraalVM Native Image.

## Functional Requirements
- **Automated Builds:** Trigger Gradle builds automatically on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
- **Cross-Platform Compilation:** The pipeline must configure environments to build native executables for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Testing:** Automatically execute unit and integration tests as part of the build pipeline.
- **Release Automation:** Automate the creation of GitHub Releases containing the compiled native binaries for each platform when a new tag is pushed.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Use an industry-standard CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Ensure the build environment has the correct version of GraalVM and JNA dependencies available.

## Out of Scope
- Implementing new MIDI features or CLI arguments.
- Distributing to package managers (like Homebrew) (this can be a separate track).
